# Arduino-Microcontroller-Based-Soil-Moisture-Measurement

The measurement and monitoring of soil moisture are critical for various applications, including agriculture, environmental studies, and water resource management. Accurate knowledge of soil moisture content enables efficient irrigation practices, optimization of crop growth, and prevention of water wastage. In this project, we developed asystem that utilizes an Arduino Microcontroller and a soil moisture sensor to measure soil moisture levels effectively.
